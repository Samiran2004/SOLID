# SOLID Principles in OOP

# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - SOLID in TypeScript

This example demonstrates the **Single Responsibility Principle** in TypeScript, which states:

> **A class should have only one reason to change.**

This means that a class should do **only one thing**, and do it well. Responsibilities should be separated into different classes to make code more modular, maintainable, and testable.
